     <ul>
       <li>Melt 1/4 cup of butter in a medium-sized pot over medium heat. 
         Whisk in the flour and cook for a couple of minutes until light golden. Add in the onion and cook until transparent (about 2-3 minutes),
         then add the garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds). </li>   
       <li>Pour in the milk (or half and half), whisking constantly until the white sauce thickens (about 5 minutes). Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and cayenne (If using). If the sauce is too thick, add another 1/4 cup of milk to the sauce, 
         whisking it through until reaching your desired thickness.</li>   
       <li>For the spinach: melt the remaining butter in a separate pan, and add spinach in batches, wilting each batch before adding the next, until all spinach is wilted. (Add a small spoon of water if the pan gets too dry.)Alternatively: Cook the spinach in a pot of boiling water for just one minute; then immerse in a cold water bath to stop the cooking process. 
         Squeeze out any excess water from the leaves and set aside.</li>   
         <li>Season the cream sauce with salt, pepper, nutmeg and cayenne. 
           Add wilted spinach to the cream sauce, stirring gently to combine. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and serve immediately.</li>

       <h3>Instruction:</h3>
       <ul>
         <li><strong>Proof the yeast:</strong>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. 
          Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.<br>
          After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. 
          The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.<br>
          (Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)</li>   
         <li><strong> Make and knead the pizza dough: </strong> Using the mixing paddle attachment, 
           mix in the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil on low speed for a minute. 
           Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.<br>
            Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.<br>
            If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.<br>
            The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</li>  

         <li><strong>Let the dough rise:</strong>  Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. 
           Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.<br>
            At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. 
            A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. 
            A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.<br>
            Cover the dough with plastic wrap.<br>
            For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.<br>
            For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) 
            for 8 hours. 
            For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).<br>
            The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.</li>   
            <li><strong>Bake pizza:</strong>  Bake pizza one at a time until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10-15 minutes. 
              If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>

          <h2> Homemade Mayo</h2>
          <img src="mayo.jpg" alt="Homemade mayo"  width="300">
          <p class="into">
              Didn’t eat mayonnaise very often when I wasn’t vegan because it’s not a healthy food and is also full of fat. Although vegan mayonnaise 
              is healthier and cholesterol-free, it’s not a healthy food either, so I eat it occasionally.

          </table>
          <h3>Instruction:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>It’s really important the milk and the oil are at the same temperature, that way the mayonnaise is easier to make. I’ve made mayo using cold milk and oil at room temperature and sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn’t.</li>   
            <li>I usually use an immersion blender, but I’ve also tried to make it using a regular blender and it works as well, although I think it’s easier to make with an immersion blender.</li>   
            <li>For the spinach: melt the remaining butter in a separate pan, and add spinach in batches, wilting each batch before adding the next, until all spinach is wilted. (Add a small spoon of water if the pan gets too dry.)Alternatively: Cook the spinach in a pot of boiling water for just one minute; then immerse in a cold water bath to stop the cooking process. 
              Squeeze out any excess water from the leaves and set aside.</li>   
            <li><em>If you’re using an immersion blender:</em>  combine all the ingredients in the blender cup, place the immersion blender in, so that way it sits firmly on the bottom of the cup and pulse until the mayonnaise emulsify. Once most of the vegan mayo has emulsified, you can move the blender up and down to incorporate any oil that is sitting on the top.</li>
            <li><em>If you’re using a regular blender:</em> place all the ingredients in the blender, except the oil and blend for about 5 seconds. Then add the oil gradually while the blender is going, turned it gradually from low to high and let it go until thickens.</li>   
            <li>Try the mayonnaise and add more salt if needed. If it’s too thick, add more milk and if is too watery add more oil. Pulse again until the mayonnaise has the perfect consistency.</li>  
            <li>Keep in a sealed container in the fridge for about 3 to 4 days.</li>  
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
